# LFW emotion dataset

LFW emotion dataset is annotated based on [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) (Labeled Faces in the Wild).

This dataset consists of two parts and can be used for the following study:

* **LFW-FER:**  LFW dataset annoteted manually for facial expression recoginition study.
* **M-LFW_FER:**  LFW dataset processed by automatic wearing face mask method for masked facial expression recoginition study.


## LFW-FER dataset

LFW-FER denotes LFW dataset annoteted for facial expression recoginition study.

We manually annotate LFW dataset according to three types of facial expressions (positive, negative, neural), which contain five types of facial orientations (up, left, center, right, down).

Some pictures, difficult to distinguish expression, are removed and 10487 out of 13000 samples are selected from LFW to obtian a LFW-FER dataset finally.

## M-LFW-FER dataset

LFW-FER denotes LFW dataset processed by automatic wearing face mask method for masked facial expression recoginition study.
